Rusting images is an image manipulation software. You can apply a few codecs specified in this [[./docs/projeto2_quantizacao.pdf][document]] (in portuguese).
You can find the documents folder the [[./docs/report.pdf][report]] with the findings of this project.

* Instructions

You are suppose to use Nix to build the project, via ~nix build~. However, within ~nix develop~, you can run ~cargo~ commands,
such as:

#+begin_src bash
  $ cargo run -- c1 ./assets/kodim03.png
  $ cargo build
  $ cargo run -- c2 ./assets/kodim03.png
#+end_src

It should be possible to use your own external ~cargo~, i.e., the one you installed yourself,
assuming the version will be correct (it should be version 1.75.0).

* Observations

- Images generated via the software will add suffixes to the name for better differentiation,
  e.g., ~image_c1.bmp~, ~image_cimap.png~.
- No parallelization and/or concurrency is being used in the latest version of ~rusting-images~.
